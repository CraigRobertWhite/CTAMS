# Community Theatre Audition Management System (CTAMS)
#### University of North Carolina at Charlotte - ITSC 1213 Spring 2018

#### I do not condone any indivduals taking classes at UNCC to use my code to complete assignments.

### Background
- This project was very important to me because it showed me that I could overcome any challenge if I persevered enough.

- At the time of writing this README, I cannot find the actual instructions from the course. However, the basic goal was
  for students to outline classes and a console-menu system for users to interact with objects. I recall that the assignment
  just needed to be a simple console-menu and most of the code could have been written in pseudo code. I took it upon myself
  to learn how to my GUIs with Java, make a login system, etc. all within two days. It was a bad decision at the time but
  because of this decision I showed myself, and others, that I could do above the ordinary and persevere. This decision also
  resulted in people remembering me enough to invite me to take the steps that would lead to my first internship at MedShift,
  which has changed my life. This showed me that if you put 100% effort into everything you do, it doesn't go unnoticed and
  you will get rewarded.

### The project
 - Have two different users, Directors and Actors, that can login to their individual accounts and interact with different
   sections of the GUI application.
    - Directors would be able to create events and positions for those events for Actors to apply for.
    - Actors would be able to apply for positions.
    - Once the Actors had applied for the positions, Directors could rate the Actors on a scale of 1 to 5.
    - Once the Directors had rated the them, Actors would be able to view what their rating were.

### Download `CTAM.jar` and run it to run the project then refer to `CTAM Guide.pdf` for instructions on how to use it.
